# moviestowatch

Use Case: List of Movies I want to watch at some point.  
Can’t find where I can stream them online at the time I want to watch them and don’t want to search away for hours. So this Make Scenario does the hard work for me.

Using a Google Sheet to track which movies to watch, this Make Scenario searches JustWatch and updates the google sheet with the places each movie can we watched.
